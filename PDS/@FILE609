//***FILE 609 is a set of packages from John Miller.  Two of them   *   FILE 609
//*           allow you to set up a RESCUE system (i.e. a miniature *   FILE 609
//*           IPLable system which allows you to fix another MVS    *   FILE 609
//*           system).  One is older, and is in member RESCUE.  The *   FILE 609
//*           other is for OS/390 2.10, and is in member RESCUE20.  *   FILE 609
//*                                                                 *   FILE 609
//*           A new, fixed version of RESCUE20 has been supplied    *   FILE 609
//*           by Chris Buckley.  This version has various           *   FILE 609
//*           improvements, as described in member $$DOC of the     *   FILE 609
//*           (PDSLOAD-) unloaded pds which is member RESCUNEW in   *   FILE 609

//*    >>>>>  up-to-date version here, as per John Miller's         *   FILE 609
//*           endorsement.  I have included all the versions,       *   FILE 609
//*           because someone may need one, rather than another.    *   FILE 609
//*                                                                 *   FILE 609

//*           Member ZCLONE30 was added for later systems (circa    *   FILE 609
//*           z/OS 1.11 or thereabouts).  This member is a pds      *   FILE 609
//*           in IEBUPDTE SYSIN format or PDSLOAD format.           *   FILE 609
//*                                                                 *   FILE 609
//*           These members are unloaded PDSes, in PDSLOAD format,  *   FILE 609
//*           which preserves the ISPF statistics.  A job is        *   FILE 609
//*           provided, called $PDSLOAD, to create the individual   *   FILE 609
//*           unloaded PDSes.                                       *   FILE 609

//*           A third package called RFLD, has now been moved to    *   FILE 609
//*           CBT Tape File 827.  This is to help maintain the      *   FILE 609
//*           RACF dataset.                                         *   FILE 609

//*           A fourth package is called ACTIVE, and it is a REXX   *   FILE 609
//*           function to return whether a certain JOB is running   *   FILE 609
//*           currently on your MVS system.                         *   FILE 609
