REXXSAMP - Sample Rexx function in assembler

What it does:
-----------------------------------------------
This assembler program (named ACTIVE) is invoked from the Rexx
interpretive environment, and is invoked the same way as a
built-in Rexx function.  This particular program is passed a 1-8
character string containing the name of an MVS job, and returns a
boolean value of true if the job is running, or false if the job
is not running.  ("Job" can be an STC, JOB or TSU.)

How to transfer file to the MVS host.
-----------------------------------------------

- Create a PDS on the MVS system, called userid.TEMP, or some
  such name.  CYL(1,1,15) is big enough.
  RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=6160 are suitable DCB parameters.

- Download the REXXSAMP.EXE self-extracting file to a PC.  Place
  REXXSAMP.EXE in a directory by itself, and run it.  This will
  result in all required members being extracted. (These won't be
  readable on a PC  See note below)

- FTP all the extracted files from the PC to the MVS PDS
  allocated in the first step.  Use the FTP subcommand: "BINARY"
  or equivalent to specify a binary transfer.  This is a must.
  (These FTP'd files become members of the target PDS.)

- Read the $$$$$DOC member in the PDS for further instructions.


NOTE: The files that are in this self-extracting zip file are in
EBCDIC format, so they will look like garbage on the PC, even
after being extracted.  They will however be normal, readable
EBCDIC PDS members after they are extracted and transferred to an
MVS host using Binary mode.
